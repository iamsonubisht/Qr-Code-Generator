### 1. What is QR Code?
Introduction
QR is short for Quick Response. A QR code is a type of matrix barcode first designed in 1994 for the automotive industry in Japan. A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached.

### 2. QR Code vs Barcode
While QR Codes and Barcodes are similar in practice, QR Codes contain more information because they have the ability to hold information both horizontally and vertically.

Barcodes only use horizontal information.

### 3. Types of QR Code:
#### 3.1. Static QR Code:
A Static QR Code contains information that is fixed and uneditable once the Code has been generated.

Usecases:
 - QR Codes in business cards or product packaging
 - QR Codes for personal use like a party invitation
 - QR Codes for Gyms

#### 3.2. Dynamic QR Code:
Dynamic QR Codes allow you to update, edit and modify the type of the QR Code however many times you need i.e. the content is editable.

Usecases:
 - QR Codes for Coupons
 - QR Codes for Social media
